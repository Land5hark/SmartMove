# **App Name**: MoveAssist

## Core Features:

- AI-Powered Inventory: Utilize image recognition to automatically identify and tag items in the box, using AI to suggest item names and categories. The LLM will function as a tool in suggesting room placement, determining which items make the most sense given the box contents.
- QR Code Management: Generate unique QR codes for each box, linking to its digital inventory record. Implement a scanning interface for quick access to the box's contents and assigned room.
- Smart Room Assignment Display: Display the scanned items with their predicted destination room.
- Printable Inventory Reports: Generate a printable inventory summary including box number, QR code, photo of contents, list of tagged items, and assigned room.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#64B5F6) to evoke trust and efficiency. This hue implies cleanliness and organization without being sterile.
- Background color: Light grey (#F0F4F7), a desaturated version of the primary hue. Provides a neutral backdrop to emphasize content, contributing to a minimalist aesthetic that promotes clarity.
- Accent color: Pale purple (#9575CD), analogous to the primary, to highlight key interactive elements, particularly the confirmation and submission controls.
- Clean, sans-serif font (like system default) for clear readability across the app.
- Use simple, intuitive icons for categories and actions (camera, QR code, room symbols).
- Ensure a simple, single-column layout optimized for mobile screens to promote intuitive navigation.
